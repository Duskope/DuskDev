            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Noah. I am the sole-operator of DuskDev. I started to practice coding with HTML, CSS, and JS when I was 18. At the start of this process, my goal was to be a part of a bigger company, dabbling in react.js for better job opportunities, and just wanted a job as a web developer. But I realized the freedom I could have working for myself, and the opportunity to do things my way. Being able to help small businesses so they don't have to go through big companies that charge clients crazy amount of money for standard websites. By starting my LLC, I run my company how I please, competing with the bigger companies at prices that they can't beat, with quality work that matches or typically exceeds them.
            </p>
            <h2>Quality over quantity</h2>
            <p>
                Operating on only a Linux-powered laptop, DuskDev is a one-man show, ensuring a personalized touch to every project. Utilizing industry-standard tools such as Visual Studio Code and GitHub, combined with testing on Google Chrome and Netlify for hosting, DuskDev guarantees websites that not only meet but exceed expectations. My streamlined approach allows to keep costs low without compromising on the quality of the product.
            </p>
            <p>
                While based in Eastern North Carolina, DuskDev LLC extends its services throughout the US. Thanks to the virtual nature of operations, DuskDev can cater to clients nationwide, offering them the same level of dedication and expertise that defines our local services.
            </p>
            <p>
                These websites are created one at a time, so I can concentrate my focus on making them exactly how the client wants it without getting off-track. 
            </p>
            <h2>Looking out for small businesses</h2>
            <p>
                Ever noticed how big web development companies charge an arm and a leg for what seems like a basic website? I did too. I have seen companies pay over $30k on a basic website with poor performance and average SEO, just because it was from a big company. The internet is a vast space filled with endless possibilities, and everyone deserves to get their place on the web. This is where DuskDev shines, offering quality that matches or exceeds the big guys, all at a price that makes sense.
            </p>
            <h2>What does "DuskDev" mean?</h2>
            <p>
                Why the name "DuskDev"? When I was a younger, I wanted a unique online name that no one else had. I came up with "Duskope". It doesn't really mean anything, but no one else had it. That's what I used as my gamertag on many videogames or websites. I just crossed "Duskope" and "Development" to get DuskDev. Simple, but people care about the service, not the name.
