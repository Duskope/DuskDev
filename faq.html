                    Prices for websites can vary, depending on the number of pages and amount of work required. You will never be charged by the hour, except for optional edits after site has been sold. Sure you could pay a budget developer to make you something super cheap, but don't expect great quality. At DuskDev you get your money's worth. Contact me to get a quote.

                    If you are enrolled with the monthly payment plan, you may cancel at any time, but you will not be allowed to keep the website or code. Once the website is paid in full, the website and code is yours to keep. If you are paying lump-sum and have payed your initial down payment, but have failed to pay the rest, you will not be allowed to keep the code after cancelling, and the down payment will not be returned. Work isn't free.

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    You have the option to pay lump sum, or monthly payments with 0$ down. With the lump sum option, you will pay half of the full price up front for production, and the other half when the website is finished. Once the final payment is made the website and code are yours to keep. With the monthly payment option, you pay $0 down, and pay per - month for a required minimum of 12 months. Once the final payment is made, the website and code are yours to keep. If you choose to cancel before the site is paid off, the website will be reclaimed.

                    DuskDev will host your website, with either your own domain or a domain purchased for you. You will be billed monthly for hosting and purchased domain. Websites are hosted with Netlify. Should you wish to do this on your own, the code will be sent to you and you must host it yourself.

                    You may send in your own website design if you wish, and I will recreate it as accurate as possible. Otherwise, I will create a design for you, and will review design schemes with you before beginning the process.
